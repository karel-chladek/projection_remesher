# projection_remesher
easy lightweight remesher of models in obj

# Function
Remesher takes user chosen primitive, that will be projected on given model.
It can replace bad tropology and lower down polygon count. Currently it is really dependent on primitive choice.
Hopefully in future i can manage to increase time efficiency and add adaptive projection.


# about
Project was created when i tried to find easy algorithm for merging several objects for Fidentis project at Fakulty of Informatics Masaryk University .

Visualizing program was co-created by Filip Mrazek
